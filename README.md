*Hive signature detected inbound from sector 36. ETA 78 minutes! All pilots to their mecha!*

Silver Star is a game about the courageous pilots of giant mecha who selflessly defend their space from outside threats. They are simultaneously fighting the relentless assault of the giant kaiju monstrosities from the Star Hive, thwarting the machinations of the ever expanding Xiphir Empire, and working to rebuild and unify the fractious Free States. Suit up, it's time to defend your home!      

The game is an RPG with a focus on mecha action. Character mechanics are based on *The Black Hack*, and specifically it uses the *Mecha Hack*. Faction mechanics come from *Stars Without Number*. While the idea for Trouble and Lairs come from *An Echo Resounding*. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of all the above.
